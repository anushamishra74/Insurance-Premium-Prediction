# Insurance-Premium-Prediction
# Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

# Dataset:
Source of dataset : Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noordeen/insurance-premium-prediction)

# Approach:
Steps to approach the problem:

1. **Libraries**: Imported required libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborne, and Sklearn.
2. **Data Exploration**: Exploring data using above mentioned libraries.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing and duplicate values.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualized data using matplotlib and seaborne.Detected outliers and worked on the treatment of outliers.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Applyied one-hot encoding to convert categorical values into numerical values.
6. **Model Training**: Applied different regression ML algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression to train the model.
7. **Model Selection**: On the basis of R2 score of all the models, Random Forest Regressor is selected.

# Conclusion:
Applied different machine learning regression algorithms. Evaluated the performance of all the models and compared their results. It is observed that the Random Forest Regressor performed better with an R2 score of 89%.
